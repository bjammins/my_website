abstract = "The objective of this analysis was to identify the presence or absence of 38 postpartum hemorrhage preparedness elements in hospitals in New Jersey and Georgia as a component of the Postpartum Hemorrhage Project of the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses. The results of this analysis were: The mean number of elements present was 23.1 (SD = 5.2; range = 12â€“34). Volume of births, students, magnet status, and other hospital characteristics did not predict preparedness. None of the hospitals had all of the 38 preparedness elements available. Less than 50% of the hospitals had massive hemorrhage protocols, performed risk assessments and drills, or measured blood loss. For every 10% increase in the total percentage of African American women who gave birth, there was a decrease of one preparedness element."
