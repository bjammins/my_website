abstract = "The objective of the study is to conduct interrater reliability testing of the Maternal Fetal Triage Index, a standardized tool for obstetric triage.  The setting of the study was a birth unit of a suburban hospital located in a large metropolitan region with approximately 5,200 births annually.  Ten registered nurses provided triage assessments of 211 pregnant women. Using blinded paired triage assessments, we assessed the   reproducibility of the triage priority levels assigned using the MFTI.Priority levels assigned by the MFTI research nurse and the study nurses were in agreement for 154 of the 211 triage assessments. The strength of agreement was classified as goodbased upon the weighted kappa score of 0.65. There was no statistically significant difference in the accuracy of assigning priority levels between the day and night shifts. The interrater reliability of the MFTI met the minimum strength of agreement threshold goal of 0.60 when used by nurses in a large birth unit to assign priority for evaluation. Based on this finding, the MFTI can be recommended for use in obstetric triage settings. Additional testing should be done to measure how this standardized tool improves care processes and outcomes."
