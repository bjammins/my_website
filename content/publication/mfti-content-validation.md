abstract = "The objective of the study was to describe the development and content validity testing of the Maternal Fetal Triage Index (MFTI), a standardized tool for obstetric triage.  In the first round of testing, a total of 12 of 61 items in the MFTI did not meet the I-CVI threshold of greater than 0.78 because of disagreement about clinical condition or priority level placement. In the second round of testing, all but 3 of the 69 content items in the revised version of the MFTI had I-CVI thresholds greater than 0.78. These 3 items were related to vital sign values. The overall S-CVI score calculated for Round 2 only was 0.95, which was greater than the threshold of 0.90.The results of the content validity testing of multidisciplinary validators suggest that the MFTI is a valid tool for use in obstetric triage and evaluation settings."
